## Usage

First, install the stuff and open your terminal. Then navigate to holy-sheet and run the server.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Now open [host 3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and fetch data with /posts/(put the row you want to use). Every line in the output is a column.

## About
This is an API using Google Sheets (literally) as a server. Right now there are not much data in there, just seven rows of weird things. My goal is to create a server full of stuff I care about like cubing algorithms, programming knowledge, my toy car data, images of stuff, etc. Goodbye and have fun.
